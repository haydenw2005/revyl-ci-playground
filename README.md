# Revyl CI Playground

A standalone GitHub repository designed to exercise Revyl's pinned-version build ingestion from real CI pipelines.

## Purpose

This repository provides minimal, working examples that:

- Builds an Expo (EAS) Android APK and publishes it to Revyl via `from_url`
- Builds a React Native Android release APK and publishes it via presigned upload
- Has a fast Dummy path that skips real builds by generating a tiny file (for smoke tests)
- After publish, each workflow triggers tests against the just-published pinned version
- Each workflow verifies the version exists and that `/builds/resolve` returns a valid download URL

## Setup

### Required Secrets

Configure these secrets in your GitHub repository settings:

- `REVYL_BASE_URL` - Your Revyl API base URL (e.g., `https://api.revyl.dev/builds`)
- `REVYL_API_KEY` - Your Revyl API key
- `EXPO_TOKEN` - Expo access token (optional, only needed for Expo workflow)

### Required Variables

Configure these repository variables:

- `REVYL_BUILD_VAR_ANDROID` - UUID of your Android build variable in Revyl

### Local Development

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm ci
```

## How It Works

### Version Naming

Each workflow generates a unique version string in the format:

```
pr-<PR_NUMBER>-<RUN_NUMBER>
```

For example: `pr-42-1`, `pr-42-2`, etc.

### Workflows

1. **Dummy Smoke Test** (`revyl-dummy-smoke.yml`)

   - Generates a tiny 200KB file
   - Publishes via presigned upload
   - Fast execution for smoke testing

2. **Expo Android** (`revyl-expo-android.yml`)

   - **Demo Mode**: Creates dummy build.json for testing `from_url` workflow
   - **Production Mode**: Builds APK using EAS Build (requires EAS project setup)
   - Publishes via `from_url` endpoint
   - Requires `EXPO_TOKEN` secret

3. **React Native Android** (`revyl-rn-android.yml`)
   - Builds APK using Gradle
   - Publishes via presigned upload
   - Uses Android SDK and Java 17

### Triggering Workflows

Open a pull request to trigger all workflows. Each workflow will:

1. Build/generate the artifact
2. Publish to Revyl with a unique pinned version
3. Verify the version can be resolved
4. Trigger a test run against the pinned version

## Scripts

The `scripts/` directory contains TypeScript utilities:

- `publishFromUrl.ts` - Publishes builds from external URLs (Expo)
- `publishPresigned.ts` - Publishes builds via presigned upload
- `verifyResolve.ts` - Verifies published versions can be resolved
- `triggerTests.ts` - Triggers test runs with pinned versions
- `util.ts` - Common utilities and helpers

### Local Testing

You can test the scripts locally:

```bash
# Test dummy publish
npm run play:dummy

# Test expo publish (requires EXPO_TOKEN)
npm run play:expo

# Test RN publish
npm run play:rn
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Workflows don't run on fork PRs** - This is intentional for security
2. **401/403 errors** - Check your `REVYL_API_KEY` secret
3. **Missing EXPO_TOKEN** - Required for Expo workflow
4. **Artifact not found** - Build may have failed; check workflow logs
5. **Build variable not found** - Verify `REVYL_BUILD_VAR_ANDROID` variable

### Expected Outcomes

Successful workflows will show:

- Published version string in logs
- Revyl API responses
- Verification that resolve endpoint works
- Test run trigger confirmation

Failed workflows will show clear error messages indicating the issue.

## ðŸ§ª Test Run

This PR tests all three workflows:
- Dummy smoke test
- Expo Android build  
- React Native Android build

Each workflow will attempt to publish to Revyl and trigger tests.
